# Presentation on 2020

So, it's my turn to say something now.

Today, I'm gonna share you guys a funny story that really happened in my life.

Back in the summer vocation, I was thinking, we are uncomfortable with the repetitive work of so many people doing in isolation, day by day, year by year. I mean seriously, how could things go like this and everyone is silent.

I hope to be able to turn this obscure, uncertain, and oral information and experience into open, easily acessible and shared information that we all can contribute and accumulate together.

It is my hope that as long as the as long as the ways have been taken by those who have gone already, those who come after will not have to. This is my belief and the reasons why I built this project.

So, I'm proud to present my website to you. That is **hziee.site** . And if Mrs.Kate doesn't mind, I'd like everyone to open this website on your phone now.

I offered an online view of the notes which I co-authored with a friend of mine - Thomas or 关键, as well as a download of a sort of assignment files based on cloud server.

When I was first promoting this site to my people, things didn't going so well. Someone said that you just provide everyone with answers to their practice assignments, which deprived their opportunity to think. Someone felt that I am quantifying the content of teacher's teaching, and that I am subjectively influencing people's opinions.

I was also wondering if I'm doing something wrong.Well later, I didn't think it through. Because I thought it's people who are wrong instead of me and my site.

It's the same tool used by the murderer and chief. We shouldn't regulate the behavior of chefs while hating murderers. Likewise, when we sharpen our knives , we never think about what kind of person the user is. Things are no meaning, it is the user who gives it a different meaning.

So, screw them. I don't even give a damn about what others said. Be myself, be wise, be positive. Keep calm and carry on.

Thanks.
