We learn by trying

We acquire knowledge by attempting frequently while under the risk of failure. Sometimes it means live or die, for now it's more for us to consider whether the balance between success or failure is worthy. Anyway, doing might waste time and gain little, in contrast, trying is the symbol of approaching to be better, while doing may go wrong, In fact,doing is what trying looks like, above all, I prefer trying rather than doing.
