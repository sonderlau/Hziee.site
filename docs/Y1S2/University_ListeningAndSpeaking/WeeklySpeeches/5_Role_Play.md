# Week 5 Role_Play Manuscript

## Ask for road

Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the bus station?

That's quite a long way on foot

That's ok, im looking for No.504 street this address.

Oh, it's that way. You are going in the wrong direction. Take the first on the left, turn right at the crossroads, and continue straight ahead for about a mile, you'll pass a supermarket on your left, you will find it straight ahead of you.

## Dream Trip

Because of the dream, so brave of choice, they only trials and hardships.
With its scene-stealing natural beauty and multitude of things to see and do, Ireland is my dream tourist destination.

### Friendly people

The people of Ireland have a reputation for being welcoming and friendly, and according to a research named Visitor’s Attitudes Survey, 99% of respondents did indeed find the Irish people friendly and hospitable during their stay – something that, no doubt, makes a big impact on the overall experience.
### One of the world’s oldest languages
The Irish language is one of the ten oldest languages still spoken today. Although you’ll probably have to seek out a Irish-speaking community to hear it spoken fluently, it’s worth the effort to hear the ancient language still in day-to-day use.

Life is a trek, it is also a journey; it is a wait, it is a reunion; it is an adventure, it is also a treasure hunt; it is a tear, it is also a song. Right now, i'm keeping moving forward to my dream destination Ireland.
