# Why Zoning Out is Good for You

---

The science of us presents the upside of zoning out. There's a lot of talk these days about mindfulness.You know focusing hard on the present and on what's happening around you not letting stray thoughts take over

**There's nothing wrong with being mindful now and then, but guess what, zoning out is also crucial to your mental health.Think of your consciousness as a spectrum, on one end lies total awareness or mindfulness,** 

but all the way on the other end, there's something you could call mindlessness where you're totally unfocused on the task at hand.

**both mindfulness and mindlessness and everything in between are useful and even though researchers usually talk about the importance of focusing.It's super useful to unfocused too.**

In fact, it's almost impossible to maintain a state of constant mindfulness. The human mind just isn't built for it, research shows that our minds wander roughly 50% of the time 

**From an evolutionary perspective .It just wouldn't make sense for our species to space out that much.If it didn't bring major benefits and sure enough it does .**

When our minds wander , they're pulled towards unresolved issues or future goals during those spaced out periods creative insight happends.Ideas you never would have consciously connected seem to come together on their own.

**Suddenly it becomes clear why your best friend seemed distant at dinner last night or what you should buy your dad for his birthday but with mindfulness you can get so caught up in the present moment.That there's no room for ideas to find each other.**

If you want tomaximize your creative mindlessness , let your mind wander while you're doing routine tasks, when you can be on autopilot it's much easier and safer to space out. 

**That's one reason why you're so likely to have eureka moments in the shower or on the subway .And the next tiime you forget your keys or lose your train of thought don't beat yourself up about it, you're just talking steps towards zoned-out brilliance.**
